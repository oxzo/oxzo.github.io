Many people start meditating with a specific expectation: to clear their mind, to find immediate peace, or to fix something broken inside. They treat it like a task to be completed, with a pass/fail condition.

But there is an alternative way to look at it.

Think of meditation as leaving for an adventure in your own mind. You are stepping into a landscape that is yours and ever-changing, yet often unexplored.

On some days, you might walk through familiar scenes or stumble upon cute "animals"—fleeting moments of joy or nostalgia. On others, you might find yourself in the middle of a violent storm, or face-to-face with monsters you've spent years avoiding. You might even find things that defy description entirely.

It is fun to embrace this adventure!

If you go into your mind with the expectation of only finding a quiet meadow, you will be disappointed. Worse, you will miss the sheer fun of the exploration.

The point isn't to control the weather or banish the monsters. It's to enjoy the journey. To see what lives there.

And if you happen to learn something about the ecosystem of your own consciousness along the way? Well, that's just a nice bonus.

That is the real adventure.
